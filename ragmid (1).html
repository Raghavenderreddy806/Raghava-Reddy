                          Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist, widely acknowledged to be one of the greatest and most influential physicists 
                          of all time. Einstein is best known for developing the theory of relativity, but he also made important contributions to the
                           development of the theory of quantum mechanics. Relativity and quantum mechanics are the two pillars of modern physics.
                            His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from relativity theory, has been dubbed "the world's most famous 
                            equation". His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.
                             He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of 
                             the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the development of quantum theory. 
                          His intellectual achievements and originality resulted in "Einstein" becoming synonymous with "genius"

                        <li>TAs spring weather starts to peek out from behind the gray clouds, we love to see the return of our feathery friends. These amazingly sleek birds, Sandhill Cranes, showcase their vibrant colored heads and dramatic long legs to our staff throughout the spring and summer.  We believe they nest in the long grasses of the marshy area around our building. It is a joy to see their natural beauty, but in all fairness, we need to startle them away from our front doors by making loud noises because they are causing damage to our propertyt Einstein was once asked what mankind's greatest invention was, he replied: "Compound interest." There's even one claim that Einstein called compound interest the "8th Wonder of the World."

                            While there is some debate about whether Einstein really said any of this or not, there's no question that the compounding of interest is a brilliant thing. As another great American, Benjamin Franklin, described it: "Money makes money. And the money that money makes, makes money." That is probably the simplest explanation of compound interest you'll ever hear.
